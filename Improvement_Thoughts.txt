-) 2-pass encoding as soon as HQ mode is being used
	
	After additional tests, even the tweaked 2-pass commands generally produce worse results than single pass for b:v <200.
	Perhaps I'm going to add a warning/prompt and let the user decide how to proceed.
	Problem is, that would interfere with continuous encoding.
	
-) Constant quality vs. constrained quality vs. VBR

	After a quite extensive test of mine, I decided to use classic VBR over constrained quality (crf combined with b:v).
	Far more important for the quality is setting qmax, which can be done regardless. 
	Otherwise VBR is more stable when it comes to using a calculated birate. Constrained quality often massively under/overshoots the target filesize.
	
	Constant quality (crf with b:v 0) is still a mystery to me. It somehow heavily depends on 2-pass encoding (very low quality after scene cuts, when using single pass).
	When used during 2-pass encoding, the results are mixed. Some frames look better than with VBR, others worse. In general there seems to be a problem with fast movement.
	Gonna test it further, but right now it doesn't seem like it's worth including.
	
-) Colormatrix conversion

	If the input video has a BT.709 color matrix, then the colors of the produced webm may be slightly off.
	This is always the case for VP8 as it only supports the BT.601 color matrix and also happens with VP9, if the produced webm isn't HD as well. 
	The filter colormatrix=bt709:bt601 solves this problem.
	Still trying to figure out how to detect the input color matrix reliable via ffprobe. At least I'm going to add a warning to the wiki.

-) Options creep

	I think it's necessary to provide options to temporarily override the most important constants of the script.
	At the same time this make the help text and commands more complicated and after all I wanted to make a script with minimal user input.
	Perhaps I'm going to add an advanced option menu with select+case.
	
-) File size adjustment during audio showcase mode

	Currently the video option is prone to result in too large files, if the input video stream isn't a static picture.
	The resulting slideshow doesn't get affected that much by increasing the keyframe interval.
	Further downscaling would solve this problem. Not sure if I'm only gonna do it for the video option or auto/manual as well.
