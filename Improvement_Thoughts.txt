-) 2-pass encoding as soon as HQ mode is being used
	
	Using/tweaking the alternate reference frame seems to massively improve the result of 2-pass encoding.
	Even with very low video bitrates 2-pass encoding seems to provide better results.
	Currently testing whether or not I should remove the bitrate/bpp requirements for it. If yes, the -q/-c flag will ultimately decide between 2-pass and single pass.
	
-) Constant quality vs. constrained quality vs. VBR

	After a quite extensive test of mine, I decided to use classic VBR over constrained quality (crf combined with b:v).
	Far more important for the quality is setting qmax, which can be done regardless. 
	Otherwise VBR is more stable when it comes to using a calculated birate. Constrained quality often massively under/overshoots the target filesize.
	
	Constant quality (crf with b:v 0) is still a mystery to me. It somehow heavily depends on 2-pass encoding (very low quality after scene cuts, when using single pass).
	When used during 2-pass encoding, the results are mixed. Some frames look better than with VBR, others worse. In general there seems to be a problem with fast movement.
	Gonna test it further, but right now it doesn't seem like it's worth including.
	
-) Colormatrix conversion

	It was brought to my attention, that converting an HD video to webm using VP8, can lead to the colors being off. 
	The reason seems to be that VP8 only supports BT.601, while HD videos usually use BT.709. 
	To avoid it, this filter needs to be used: colormatrix=bt709:bt601
	I'm have very little knowledge on the matter. There were cases, where I didn't notice any difference when using this filter and times, where I definitely did. 
	
	VP9 doesn't have this problem.
