-) Refine the adjustment of buffer size (low/medium/high bitrate, audio yes/no)

-) Add skip_threshold only for very difficult encodes

-) Automatic decision when to switch bitrate mode / 2-pass encoding (remove need for flags in the process)

-) Add option to use vp9/opus instead of vp8/vorbis

-) Check if there are any files in to_convert

-) Think of a way to customize single files (different sub-folders for differnt settings?)

-) Add fail-safe switches for the resolution / length limits

-) Use bits/pixel value to scale down videos if their quality would be too low otherwise (add flag to force input bitrate)

-) Set default values during trim mode (start=0, end=length), if the user only hits enter
