-) Think of a way to customize single files (different sub-folders for differnt settings?)

-) Add fail-safe switches for the resolution / length limits

-) Set default values during trim mode (start=0, end=length), if the user only hits enter

-) Add warning if audio bitrate leads to a negative video bitrate for very long videos (skip file and put info into txt file)

-) For HQ mode: Force the user to specify how much to further downscale and/or trim the video if downscale+framedrop isn't enough to reach bpp threshold

-) Find a way to read user defined scale in order to use height/width in calculations (very low priority as I think it's pretty complicated for minimal gain)

-) Refine function to choose audio bitrate

-) Do extensive tests with the new limiter to figure out it's effectiveness (especially if it fixes the extreme cases of overshooting the file size limit with VP9)

-) Add audio showcase mode. Use static image as video stream, reduce framerate to 1fps, increase keyframe interval and use higher audio bitrate
