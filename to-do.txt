-) Think of a way to customize single files (different sub-folders for differnt settings?)

-) Add fail-safe switches for the resolution / length limits

-) Set default values during trim mode (start=0, end=length), if the user only hits enter

-) Fix error where a high audio bitrate leads to a negative video bitrate for very long videos (either disable audio automatically or try to reduce audio bitrate)

-) Add HQ mode. If bits per pixel value is not high enough, force the user to specify how much to downscale and/or trim the video (show how much is necessary to reach the threshold)

-) Find a way to read user defined scale in order to use height/width in calculations (very low priority as I think it's pretty complicated for minimal gain)

-) Refine function to choose audio bitrate

-) Do extensive tests with the new limiter to figure out how prone it is to loop too much
