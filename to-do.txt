Stuff that still needs to be implemented / fixed (sorted by priority):

	-) Test new adjuster function to make sure it works flawlessly

	-) Circumvent unnecessary encoding if the last attempt is also the best try

	-) Add audio showcase mode. Use static image as video stream, reduce framerate to 1fps, increase keyframe interval and use higher audio bitrate

	-) Improve HQ mode
		-> Force the user to specify how much to further downscale and/or trim the video if downscale+framedrop isn't enough to reach bpp threshold
		-> Add additional requirements (bitrate?) for 2-pass encoding

	-) Improve audio function
		-> Increase max. possible audio bitrate to 192kbps
		-> Tweak the current makeshift function to choose the audio bitrate
		
	-) Add warning / force user input if audio bitrate leads to a negative video bitrate (low priority as it only happens with insane video length / file size combos)
		
	-) Think of a way to customize single files (different sub-folders for differnt settings?)

	-) Find a way to read user defined scale in order to use height/width in calculations (very low priority as I think it's pretty complicated for minimal gain)
