-) Automatic decision when to switch to 2-pass encoding (remove need for flag in the process)

-) Add option to use vp9/opus instead of vp8/vorbis

-) Check if there are any files in to_convert

-) Think of a way to customize single files (different sub-folders for differnt settings?)

-) Add fail-safe switches for the resolution / length limits

-) Add flag to disable automatic downscaling

-) Set default values during trim mode (start=0, end=length), if the user only hits enter

-) Fix error where a high audio bitrate leads to a negative video bitrate for very long videos (either disable audio automatically or try to reduce audio bitrate)

-) Deactivate automatic downscaling if the user set the scale filter manually

-) Add additional methods of reducing the filesize before using skip_threshold

-) If unable to encode a file within the specified size limit, delete the webm and put its name into a text file
