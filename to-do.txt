-) Think of a way to customize single files (different sub-folders for differnt settings?)
-) Add warning if audio bitrate leads to a negative video bitrate for very long videos (skip file and put info into txt file)
-) Find a way to read user defined scale in order to use height/width in calculations (very low priority as I think it's pretty complicated for minimal gain)
-) Add audio showcase mode. Use static image as video stream, reduce framerate to 1fps, increase keyframe interval and use higher audio bitrate

-) Improve limiter function
	-> Add iterations flag to define how many times the video bitrate should be adjusted for each bitrate mode
	-> Use video function only to choose bitrate mode
	-> Use for-loops for the bitrate adjustment of each mode
	-> Create bitrate adjustment function to clean up limiter
	-> Seperate function in case of too small files, as the steps taken should differ from the normal limiter (further adjusting bitrate instead of switching bitrate mode)
	
-) Improve audio function
	-> Increase max. possible audio bitrate to 192kbps
	-> Tweak the current makeshift function to choose the audio bitrate
	
-) Improve HQ mode
	-> Force the user to specify how much to further downscale and/or trim the video if downscale+framedrop isn't enough to reach bpp threshold
	-> Add additional requirements (bitrate?) for 2-pass encoding
